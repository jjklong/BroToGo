# BroToGo

####  Day one:
#### Today we were able to get a layout complete with simple mobile first design.  Jordan and I decided we're going to work with four different APIs.  The ones that we've chosen are: Foursquare, forecast.io, brewerydb.com, and jambase.com.  With this we hope to create a chat bot that allows the user to plan out a day of fun that includes beer and music.

#### Tonight, I was able to get the site talking to the Foursquare and Jambase API.  The extent of my call was limited to the console but it's a start.  

#### Day two:
#### Jordan and I were able to properly connect the API calls that we made to append the data to the site.  This was our biggest accomplishment so far. Everything looks great except that we only  have a mobile view made up so far.  We'll be spending the night creating a nice container to house the short cut buttons and other helpful icons. I'm thinking of creating a container to the right of the chat box.  The chat box will widen slightly and I'm also going to try another color palette.  

#### Day three:
#### Today was a great, productive day.  We had all of our APIs responding normally and populating the page with the proper data.  Our day revolved around honing in on styling for both the dektop and mobile view.  Designing mobile first presented a nice challenge.  We threw in a few replies based on specific words.  Some are nice easter eggs and the others are there to help/guide the user.  We both really enjoyed this project and it's process.  We came into this with very similar visions in mind and with that, we were able to flow nicely through this project.  Each day we remained organized with Trello and tasked our days and evenings out evenly. We now have a functioning chat-bot that can help you plan out a fun day.  I don't think either of us thought we'd ever create a form of AI, sure glad that's changed.
