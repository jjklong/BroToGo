# BroToGo

####  Day one:
#### Today we were able to get a layout complete with simple mobile first design.  Jordan and I decided we're going to work with four different APIs.  The ones that we've chosen are: Foursquare, forecast.io, brewerydb.com, and jambase.com.  With this we hope to create a chat bot that allows the user to plan out a day of fun that includes beer and music.

#### Tonight, I was able to get the site talking to the Foursquare and Jambase API.  The extent of my call was limited to the console but it's a start.  

#### Day two:
#### Jordan and I were able to properly connect the API calls that we made to append the data to the site.  This was our biggest accomplishment so far. Everything looks great except that we only  have a mobile view made up so far.  We'll be spending the night creating a nice container to house the short cut buttons and other helpful icons. I'm thinking of creating a container to the right of the chat box.  The chat box will widen slightly and I'm also going to try another color palette.
